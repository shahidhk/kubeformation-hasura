## About

**kubeformation.sh is a brand new project; don’t forget to [star the
repo](https://github.com/hasura/kubeformation) to show some ❤️!**

With Kubernetes, it becomes possible to start making everything about your
application declarative. As cloud vendors start providing managed Kubernetes
services, provisioning a Kubernetes cluster via the vendor’s API becomes
declarative as well.

Kubeformation is a simple web UI and CLI that helps you create “Google
Deployment manager” or “Azure Resoure Manager” templates which are a _little_
painful to create by hand.

Once you have this file, you can run your cloud vendor CLI on it to provision
your cluster. You can edit this file to add vendor specific configuration too.

#### Roadmap

Kubeformation is open to evolution. Current goal is to support all managed
Kubernetes vendors who support declarative specification.

- EKS support ([#10](https://github.com/hasura/kubeformation/issues/10))
- Other providers ([#11](https://github.com/hasura/kubeformation/issues/11))
